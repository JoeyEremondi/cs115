#+title: How to Debug Programs

* Debugging Compile-time Errors
- You try to compile your code, but you get an error
  + Problem happens before you run it
- Scroll up in the error messages, and look at the first one that happened in /this run of the compiler/
  + *READ THAT MESSAGE*
    - Look at the line number
    - Look at what it says
  + Read the code at the line that it's pointing to
    - Do this /before/ you start changing things
* Debugging Run-time Errors
- a.k.a. Your code runs, but does the wrong thing
- Print statements
  + ~cout~ at points in your code, that you delete before you hand your code in
- Assert statements
  + ~assert(someCondition)~
  + Your program will crash if it's false
    - But it will tell you which thing faile\
